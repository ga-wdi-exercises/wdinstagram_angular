# WDInstagram Angular

Fork and Clone

Make a simple instagram clone!

## Part 1 CRUD with dummy data

Build a simple angular app that can preform CRUD on dummy data. The data should have a: photo_url, author, & body. Add a router, and templates for at least a show & index view.

## Part 2 CRUD with API

Clone the [WDInstagram api](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/wdinstagram_rails_api) - you don't need to fork as you won't be modifying this

```shell
$ bundle install
$ rake db:create
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:seed
$ rails s
```

Create a factory that integrates with the api so that CRUD changes will be persisted

## Bonus

If you're feeling frisky add some custom directives

## Super Bonus

Combine the angular code with the Rails API
